<h1>Knight Guard</h1>

Knight Guard is a game created for Windows PC's for UNCA's Undergraduate Research Symposium of April 24, 2018. 
It is an Action-Adventure-Platformer intended to fuse the feeling of "metroidvania" titles and platformer titles like Mega Man X.

<h2>Bugs</h2>
Checkpoints and saving is not implemented and neither is the options menu

Combat is currently inconsistent requiring you to leave and renter enemy collision boxes to deal damage. 

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
Because of the lack of enemy AI the game will feel empty and not very challanging. In later iterations of the game the Enemy AI will
be the source of challenge for the player. Some areas might feel empty and this is because areas are intentionally cleared for either
a large amount of enemyâ€™s or act as a "boss arena"
